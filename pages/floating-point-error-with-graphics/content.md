You see a colored grid in a game and you're like, "hey that's a nice looking grid there." Then you stop for a moment, tilt you head, and look a little closer. Oh no. You can't unsee it. This grid of colored boxes has a white line going between them. How did the developer not see this obvious error!

<div class="floating-point-error"></div>

<p></p>

<div class="floating-point-fix"></div>
